# Binary to Decimal Converter

This project contains a Python script that converts a binary string into its decimal equivalent. The script also includes input validation to ensure that the input is a valid binary number.

## Features

- Converts a binary sequence to a decimal number.
- Validates the input to ensure it contains only '0's and '1's.
- Provides user-friendly prompts for input correction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python3 binary_to_decimal.py

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a binary sequence.

### Running the Tests

1. Ensure you have unittest (comes pre-installed with Python).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the test file.
3. Run the tests using the command:

    ```bash
    python3 test_binary_to_decimal.py

### Example

    ```bash
    Enter the binary sequence you want to convert: 1011
    Binary sequence is: 1011
    Decimal value is: 11
